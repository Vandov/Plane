# Plane
Graphics home assignment in C++ and OpenGL.

  This is a program in which you are able to register a few point on the spinning globe and make a route for the flight. Register by clicking on the globe with the left mouse button. The endpoint registration has to be made by clicking with the right mouse button. After registering the endpoint, the plane starts the flight.
  The .exe file is also included to be able to run the program on different systems, since the Visual Studio 2015 version programs need some initialization to be able to compile them.
